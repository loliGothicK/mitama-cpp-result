# Mitama.Result version 9.3.0

## Enhancements

- [Improve CMakeLists.txt #61](https://github.com/LoliGothick/mitama-cpp-result/pull/61)

	- Improve CMakeLists.txt to be able to install include dirs
	- Disable testing by default
	- Fix the problem that building Result_Test.cpp fails on macOS
	- Some improvements of CMake command usage
	
- [Support void for mitama::result #72](https://github.com/LoliGothick/mitama-cpp-result/pull/72)

	Support superficially to be able to use void for template argument of mitama::result and functions that return void for map and map_err methods like Rust. Therefore, map and map_err methods now support to have a function as an argument that type `fn(any) -> void`, `fn(void) -> any`, and `fn(void) -> void`. The reason I express these changes as 'superficially' is that it converts void to std::monostate internally.

## New features

- [Add a TRY macro like the Rust's `?` operator #63](https://github.com/LoliGothick/mitama-cpp-result/pull/63)

	This feature is based on the language extensions of gcc and clang. It is not available for other compilers. It does not conform to the language standard and cannot be used with other compilers.

- [anyhow and thiserror #87](https://github.com/LoliGothick/mitama-cpp-result/pull/87)

	- anyhow is a library that can reduce the cost of writing error handling by treating error types as `shared_ptr` of a common base type.
	- thiserror is a library that makes it easy to write domain-specific error types.
